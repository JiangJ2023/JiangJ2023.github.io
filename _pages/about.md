I'm a 2nd year PhD student from [Bertrand Lab](https://thibaultbertrand.com/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). 

During my undergraduate years, I immersed myself in Applied Mathematics at the University of Waterloo, Canada. Then I joined the University of Oxford, focusing on Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing. In the past, I studied models of avascular tumor growth and hydrodynamic microswimmers in low Reynold environments. I joined Imperial College London in Autumn 2023 as a PhD student; I will study the transport of active particles in complex environments. Ultimately, I am interested in the use of microswimmers as targeted drug delivery systems, with the aspiration of transforming cancer treatment methodologies.
